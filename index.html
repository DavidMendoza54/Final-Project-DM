    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <h2>Product Name: Designer Timer</h2>
    <h2>Team Members: David Mendoza</h2>
    <h2>Application Overview: A modern looking easy to use timer with some bells and whistles.</h2>
    <h2>Technology Overview: I will be using python and a Azure Website to host it. Also, make it into a folder so that
        anyone can just run it on their VS</h2>
    <h2>Last Updated: 12/06/2021.</h2>
    <h2>Feature List: Unique sound when timer goes off and a aesthlically pleasing font or background with the timer.
    </h2>
    <h2>Future Feature List: Adding different profiles that you can have on the timer that can customize look, sound,
        font. </h2>
    <h2>Basic Tech Features: Loops, parameters, strings, conversions, and importing files.</h2>
    <h2>Advanced Technical Features: Figuring out how to make a good looking timer with a nice font and have it all work
        on the Azure Website. </h2>
    
    <h2>Reflection: I was able to acoomplish almost everything that I wanted to. I did not accomplish adding a sound when the timer is done. I also did not acomplish my "Future Feature List". So if anyone can help make those two things happen feel free and contact me if you have any question at davidmendoza1@lewisu.edu</h2>
